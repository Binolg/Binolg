# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechanical Engineer with a growing passion for programming.

Currently enrolled in a Data Science Master's Degree.

## About Me

I'm curiosity-fueled with a passion for problem-solving. I enjoy reading, learning and strategy games.
I often find myself going down a rabbit hole while researching, and exploring various topics.

Programming became really appealing to me due to its very logical and challenging nature.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm immersed in writing my Data Science Master's thesis, focusing on "Injection Molding Process Monitoring Based on Machine Learning Algorithms". It's an exciting project that allows me to combine my engineering background with my interest in data and programming. Exploring the limited resources for real-world scenarios of unsupervised learning make it a particularly challenging task, while creating tools to solve or handle the data limitations and noise.
