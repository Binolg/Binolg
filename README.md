# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechanical Engineer specializing in hydraulics, but with a growing passion for data science and programming.

## About Me

I'm curiosity-fuelled with a passion for problem-solving. I enjoy reading, learning and strategy games.
I often find myself going down a rabbit hole while researching, diving deep and exploring various topics.

Programming became really appealing to me from it's very logical and challenging to optimize nature.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm immersed in writing my Master's thesis in Data Science, focusing on "Injection Molding Process Monitoring Based on Machine Learning Algorithms". It's an exciting project that allows me to combine my engineering background with my interest in data and programming. Exploring the limited resources for real-world scenarios of unsupervised learning make it a particularly challenging task, while creating tools to solve or handle the data limitations and data noise.
