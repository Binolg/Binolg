### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Working as a Mechanical Engineer with a focus in hydraulics.

I'm a driven and curiosity-fueled professional with a passion for problem-solving and a meticulous attention to detail. With a natural inclination for learning, I thrive in dynamic environments, quickly adapting to new challenges and absorbing new information with ease.

Currently writting my Data Science Master's thesis on "Injection Molding Process Monitoring Based on Machine Learning Algorithms".

I'm eager to leverage my skills and knowledge in data and programming to tackle new challenges.
