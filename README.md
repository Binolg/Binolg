# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechanical Engineer specializing in hydraulics, but with a growing passion for data science and programming.

## About Me

I'm a driven and curiosity-fueled professional with a knack for problem-solving and a keen attention to detail. I thrive in dynamic environments, always eager to learn and adapt to new challenges.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm immersed in writing my Master's thesis in Data Science, focusing on "Injection Molding Process Monitoring Based on Machine Learning Algorithms". It's an exciting project that allows me to combine my engineering background with my interest in data and programming. Exploring the limited resources for real-world scenarios of unsupervised learning make it a particularly challenging task, while creating tools to solve or handle the data limitations and data noise.

## Goals

I'm excited about the possibilities that data science and programming offer, and I'm eager to leverage my skills to tackle new challenges and contribute to innovative solutions.
Feel free to reach out if you want to connect or discuss potential collaborations!
